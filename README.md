# 🏨 ReplaceMarketPlace: Resell Your Bookings, Earn Forever

**ReplaceMarketPlace** is a decentralized platform that turns non-refundable bookings into digital assets. Never lose money on a canceled trip again, and earn passive income every time your booking is resold.

## 💡 The Concept: "Assets, Not Just Reservations"
In the traditional world, a non-refundable booking is a liability if you can't use it. **ReplaceMarketPlace** changes the game by turning that booking into a **Secure NFT**.
- **Can't make your trip?** Don't ask for a refund—just list it on the marketplace.
- **Found a better deal?** Sell your current booking and let someone else enjoy it.
- **Want to earn?** The original lister of a booking receives a **perpetual royalty** (5-10%) every single time that asset changes hands.

## 🗺️ How It Works (The 3-Step Flow)

1.  **Mint (Connect & Create)**: Connect your **Petra Wallet** and turn your hotel, flight, or event reservation into a digital token. Set your price and your lifetime royalty percentage.
2.  **Market (List & Sell)**: Your booking appears in our global marketplace. Buyers can browse, verify the details, and purchase instantly using **APT**.
3.  **Earn (Passive Loyalty)**: Once sold, you get your funds immediately. If that buyer then resells the booking to someone else, **you automatically receive a royalty payment** directly to your wallet. Forever.

## 🏗️ The "Blockchain Stuff" Made Simple

### why Aptos?
We use the **Aptos Blockchain** because it is the fastest and safest network for digital commerce. It ensures your transfers are instant and your booking information is immutable (it can't be tampered with).

### What is an NFT here?
Think of our NFTs as **Digital Deeds**. Instead of an email confirmation that's hard to transfer, you hold a token in your wallet. When you sell the token, you are legally and technically transferring the right to that booking.

### Perpetual Royalties
This is our "Secret Sauce." Using **Smart Contracts** (automated digital agreements), we enforce a rule that says: *"Whenever this asset is resold, X% goes back to the original creator."* This incentivizes early adoption and creates a true secondary economy.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
- **Hotel Partnerships**: Direct integration with booking engines to "auto-mint" NFTs at checkout.
- **Event Ticketing**: Combatting scalpers by price-capping resales while rewarding artists.
- **DeFi Integration**: Use your high-value booking NFTs as collateral for short-term crypto loans.
